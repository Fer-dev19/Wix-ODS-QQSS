# ¿Quién quiere ser sostenible?

This is a group project made for a college asignment. The main goal was to work together with new people following the Agile method by using the web app "Worki process" https://cliente.tuneupprocess.com/web/ monitoring changes and registering working times.

We worked together in a mobile game type app whose main goal was to expand your knowledge on SDG's (Sustainable Development Goals), all together with a Project Owner and a Scrum Master who guided us over the app's requirements, the clients demands and the time management throughout the Sprints.

The project length was 3 months aprox.
